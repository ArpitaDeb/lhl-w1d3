# W1D3 - Objects in JavaScript

In this lesson, we're going to discuss what kind of data JavaScript programs can
work with. We're going to look at how real-world data can be abstracted into
primitive data types and more complex data structures, in particular, arrays and
objects. We're then going to learn a few basic concepts about working with
objects in JavaScript.

## Learning goals

### For students

1. Define, in the context of JS: primitive data type, data structure, array,
   object, property, key, value, getter, setter, method, data structure.
2. List the seven primitives, or primitive data types, in JS.
3. Explain why it's important to match up problems with appropriate data
   structures.
4. Explain what kind of problems are more efficienty solved with arrays, and
   which with objects, and why.
5. Understand and be able to implement simple examples of the different ways of
   creating, updating and accessing data stored in JS objects.

## Prerequisites

1. Students can implement JavaScript code involving variables, arrays, simple
   loops, and simple conditional statements.
2. Students can execute JavaScript code using a command line terminal.

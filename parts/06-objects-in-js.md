## Objects in JavaScript

JavaScript objects are "a data structure containing data and instructions for
working with the data." (Mozilla Developer Network)

JS objects:

- are a collection of properties that can be added or removed (from that
  collection)
- the values of a property can by of any type, including primitive data types,
  functions, and other objects
- properties are identified by strings (and symbols), called 'keys'

This data structure is similar to what in computer science is called a _hash
table_,  or what in other languages are called dictionaries, maps, or
associative arrays.

Functions that are properties of an objects are usually called __methods__.

To access the object itself from within a method, you need to use the `this`
keyword.

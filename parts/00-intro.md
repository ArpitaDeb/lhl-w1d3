# Objects in JavaScript

In this lesson, we're going to discuss what kind of data JavaScript programs can
work with. We're going to look at how real-world data can be abstracted into
primitive data types and more complex data structures, in particular, arrays and
objects. We're then going to learn a few basic concepts about working with
objects in JavaScript.

## Scenario: We're building a timeline of computing history for a museum

## Data structures

Data structures are the ways we organize the data we're working with in a
computer program, so as to make it simpler to implement particular algorithms
more efficiently.

Note that in the term 'data structure,' we refer not only to the data itself,
but also the relationship among the data, and the operation that can be applied
to that data.
